This is a Flutter front end project I made for SAWO Labs authentication challenge based on Ssquidgame . It was great to know about Sawo labs service which makes it so much easier for quick login and prototyping. I would recommend it to everyone who is making peojects for Hackathons and Completetions. Hope You like it☺️
